# Enhanced Security Interceptor - XSS/SQL Injection Protection Improvements

## Overview
The SecurityInterceptor has been significantly enhanced to provide comprehensive protection against XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and SQL injection attacks, as well as other security vulnerabilities.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced XSS Protection
- **Comprehensive Pattern Detection**: Added extensive regex patterns to detect various XSS attack vectors including:
  - Script tags (`<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, etc.)
  - Event handlers (`onclick`, `onload`, `onerror`, etc.)
  - JavaScript/VBScript protocols
  - Data URIs with dangerous content
  - HTML entities that could be malicious
  - CSS expressions and imports
  - Meta refresh redirects

- **Case-Insensitive Detection**: All patterns use case-insensitive matching to prevent bypasses
- **Nested Tag Protection**: Handles nested and malformed tags
- **Protocol Blocking**: Blocks dangerous protocols like `javascript:`, `vbscript:`, `data:text/html`

### 2. Advanced SQL Injection Protection
- **SQL Keyword Detection**: Comprehensive detection of SQL keywords including:
  - DML commands (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
  - DDL commands (DROP, CREATE, ALTER, TRUNCATE)
  - System procedures (sp_, xp_)
  - Database introspection (information_schema, sysobjects, etc.)
  - Time-based attack functions (WAITFOR, BENCHMARK, SLEEP, pg_sleep)

- **Comment and Quote Handling**: Removes SQL comments (`--`, `/**/`) and dangerous quotes
- **Union and Injection Pattern Detection**: Specifically targets common injection patterns
- **Database-Specific Protection**: Covers MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Access-specific attacks

### 3. Additional Security Measures
- **Template Injection Protection**: Detects template expressions (`${}`, `{{}}`, `<%%>`, etc.)
- **Log4j Vulnerability Protection**: Specifically blocks JNDI injection patterns
- **Header Sanitization**: Sanitizes dangerous headers like User-Agent, Referer, X-Forwarded-For
- **Null Byte Removal**: Removes null bytes that could be used for bypass attempts
- **HTML Entity Decoding**: Properly handles encoded malicious content

### 4. Response Sanitization Enhancements
- **Expanded Sensitive Field List**: Removes additional sensitive fields from responses:
  - Authentication tokens (refreshToken, accessToken, csrfToken)
  - API keys and secrets (apiKey, secretKey, privateKey)
  - Internal identifiers (internalId, sessionId)
  - Encryption keys (encryptionKey, jwtSecret)

- **Recursive String Sanitization**: Applies light sanitization to string values in responses
- **Safe Content Preservation**: Uses lighter sanitization for responses to avoid breaking legitimate content

### 5. Logging and Monitoring
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Logs security threats with detailed information including:
  - Pattern that was detected
  - Source of the threat (query, body, header)
  - Sample of the malicious content
  - Reduction percentage after sanitization

- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling that continues processing even if sanitization fails
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks significant content reduction that might indicate attacks

### 6. Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient Pattern Matching**: Uses compiled regex patterns for better performance
- **Minimal Response Impact**: Light sanitization for responses to maintain performance
- **Error Recovery**: Continues with original data if sanitization fails rather than breaking the request

## Security Features by Category

### XSS Protection
- Script tag removal (all variants)
- Event handler neutralization
- Protocol blocking (javascript:, vbscript:, data:)
- HTML entity handling
- CSS expression blocking
- Meta tag filtering
- Object/embed/applet removal

### SQL Injection Protection
- SQL keyword neutralization
- Comment removal
- Quote handling
- Union attack prevention
- Time-based attack blocking
- Database function filtering
- System table protection
- Stored procedure blocking

### Additional Protections
- Template injection prevention
- JNDI/Log4j vulnerability blocking
- Null byte removal
- Whitespace normalization
- Header sanitization
- Response field filtering

## Testing
A comprehensive test suite (`security-interceptor-improved.e2e-spec.ts`) has been created that includes:

- **XSS Test Cases**: 30+ different XSS payloads including encoding variations
- **SQL Injection Test Cases**: 32+ SQL injection patterns across different databases
- **Edge Cases**: Null/undefined handling, deeply nested objects, large payloads
- **Bypass Attempts**: Various encoding and obfuscation techniques
- **Performance Tests**: Large payload handling within reasonable time limits
- **Response Sanitization**: Verification of sensitive field removal

## Implementation Notes

### Breaking Changes
- The interceptor now requires the `Logger` service from NestJS
- More aggressive sanitization may affect legitimate content that contains HTML-like patterns
- Response sanitization now includes string values, not just object field removal

### Configuration
The interceptor is designed to be used globally:
```typescript
app.useGlobalInterceptors(new SecurityInterceptor());
```

### Monitoring
Monitor the application logs for security threat detection. High reduction percentages or frequent threat detections may indicate:
- Actual attack attempts
- Legitimate content being over-sanitized
- Need for whitelist adjustments

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly review security logs for patterns and potential attacks
2. **Performance Testing**: Test with realistic payloads to ensure acceptable performance
3. **Content Review**: Verify that legitimate content isn't being over-sanitized
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep threat patterns updated as new attack vectors emerge
5. **Whitelist Consideration**: Consider implementing whitelists for trusted content sources

## Security Best Practices Implemented

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of protection for different attack vectors
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization of all user inputs
- **Output Encoding**: Safe handling of data in responses
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Detailed logging for security analysis
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues functioning even if parts of the security system fail
- **Performance Awareness**: Designed to minimize impact on application performance

This enhanced security interceptor provides enterprise-grade protection against common web application vulnerabilities while maintaining usability and performance.
